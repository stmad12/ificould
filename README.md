If i could, I would design a lightweight keylogger which would upload instaneously to a personal server. It 
would be able to be slipped into the school's JSS profile for the iPads. If I can find the code, I would also
find a way to SSH into or hijack the webcams. It would be a nefarious project, but would help me. 
As far as web/user side, it would also be a web site which would increase awareness for hackers. It would be a
double-edged sword in many ways, in the sense that it is both a public service which prevents hacking but it is
also a tool which hacks and steals users' data. I wonder if I can harness cookies to execute code outside of the
browser sandbox. If a browser is set to allow cookies blindly, I could be preaching cyber-security while my
cookies were injecting malicious code onto the host machine.
